              I started Uppercase in 2016 after watching the rise of social
              advertising first-hand while working at Facebook on their ad tech
              team. With a background in traditional advertising, 3 things
              struck me about Facebook and Instagram advertising
              specifically:Facebook ads are directly measurable. Historically,
              marketers had to make inferences about increases in revenue to
              determine which campaigns were successful and which were not. With
              Facebook and Instagram, you can directly see the revenue your ads
              have generated, making it much easier to determine
              success.Facebook and Instagram ads are highly targetable. There is
              no other platform that enables marketers to pinpoint their exact
              audience segments. This enables marketers to ensure that budgets
              are spent efficiently, with ad spend focused on core audience
              segments.Facebook ads are affordable. It’s very easy to scale
              budgets up and down, and companies are not obligated to have
              6-figure monthly ad budgets in order to use the platform.I was
              seeing the impact of this platform for major brands - I could only
              imagine the impact for startups and growth-stage businesses. My
              co-founder Baris and I have always had a personal passion for
              entrepreneurship - we love working with passionate founders who
              pour their heart and soul into their businesses. Because of this
              clear opportunity and need for e-commerce businesses, we launched
              Uppercase. Today we have the privilege of partnering with direct
              to consumer e-commerce companies to reach a scale they had
              previously only dreamed of. Our team is uniquely positioned to
              help businesses scale because of our expertise on both the new
              customer acquisition (advertising) AND on building
              highly-effective e-commerce websites that convert. We’re excited
              to continue to push the limits with our ecommerce partners.
